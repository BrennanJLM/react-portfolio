        My name is Brennan Merrett, and i am currently enrolled in the
        coding bootcamp program offered by the University of Toronto.
        I decided to make a career change during the lengthy pandemic
        lockdowns, and seeing how vulnerable my indusrty of work was
        during those times.  I have a friend who has recently graduated
        from a software developing program, and after talking with him
        about the kind of work hes doing, i was interested.  As soon as
        i started the program i realized that i had made a great choice.
        I'm absolutely hooked on this industry, and look forward to sharing
        my future endeavours here on my portfolio page!
